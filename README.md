# lukasrichtercz üë®
This is my personal website project.
  
You can see it running at [www.lukasrichter.cz](https://www.lukasrichter.cz).

## Technical info
It is running in a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) container provided by [ro≈°t√≠.cz](https://rosti.cz/).

It is going to be build on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and possibly some
database ([SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)) but right now it is simply
serving static files by [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).

## Management info
Project is being managed mainly by [Free YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html#section=incloud)
but I also use tools like [Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/),
[diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) and so on. 

## Development instructions

used commands.

### Deployment
Deployment is defined by [Rostifile](/Rostifile) and is done by [`rostictl`](https://docs.rosti.cz/cs/quickstart/rostictl) tool.

**Note:** It requires an access token which you can get from [Ro≈°t√≠ administration](https://admin.rosti.cz/settings/profile/regenerate-token).  
**Warning:** It is not possible to pick what files should be uploaded only which should not be so be careful about
not uploading anything unwanted.
