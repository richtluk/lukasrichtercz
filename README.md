# lukasrichtercz ðŸ‘¨
This is my personal website project.
  
You can see it running at [lukasrichter.cz](https://www.lukasrichter.cz).

## Technical info
It is running in a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) container provided by [roÅ¡tÃ­.cz](https://rosti.cz/).

It is going to be build on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) and possibly some
database ([SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)) but right now it is a [WIP](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/wip).

## Management info
Project is being managed mainly by [Free YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html#section=incloud)
but I also use tools like [Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/),
[diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) and so on.
